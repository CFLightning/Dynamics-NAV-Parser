Programming language: C#

Works with:
- Microsoft Dynamics NAV

## Description
Basic QoL work improvement - a (hopefully) NAV operated addon, enabling the user to perform several operations on the exported objects:
- Split a large file into several smaller objects, for encapsulation purposes
- Check and fix all indentations that may generate import problems
- Find all modifications marked with appropriate tags
- List all changes, group them into greater changelogs
- Fill in the changes into the `Documentation()` trigger
- Generate documentation files
- (optional/future) Sync the system with Git platform
- (QoL feature) Get the entire system working under "single button principle"
